  <p><span class='leadin'>Erich Fromm notes that</span> there are two modes of living, ‘to have’ or ‘to be’. In ‘to have’ mode of living, our existence is determined, justified through things that we own. When a man sees a flower, he picks it up to enjoy it—despite the death of that very flower. In ‘to be’ mode of living, our existence is experienced, fulfilled through the state of ‘being’. When a man sees a flower, he enjoys it through its admiration without disrupting its living.</p>

<p>In research, without much understanding of contextual complexity of the objects of study, a researcher may go to the field and interview, interrogate, dictate, dominate and disrupt their daily life in favor of the researcher’s victory over getting the data/research materials. Or, can a researcher enjoy them only by observing them from afar, so that they can still enjoy their life as usual, with no vying eyes (at least ours) scrutinizing them?</p>
