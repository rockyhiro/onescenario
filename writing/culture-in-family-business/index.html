  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>If the history of the social world is to be drawn in a single continuous line, we will find ourselves living only on its fraction&mdash;at the very front. The trail is long, rooted as far back as the earliest time of human history and it is, at the same time, always in process. Values, norms, behaviors, languages, all these are products of social interaction that we inherit, produce, and continuously reproduce. And for these, social scientists ascribe them under one umbrella term: culture.</p>

<p>To speak about culture is to acknowledge its pervasiveness. In fact, it is very difficult to associate culture exclusively as one thing or another. Culture can be understood as conceptual (in shared beliefs, values, and norms) and also practical (in patterns of behavior) (Geertz, 1973). Culture can be regarded as an objective reality (objectified in forms such as institutions or artifacts) but also a subjective one (the meanings are perceived differently by individuals) (Dyer, 1988). Culture can also be seen as something that an organization has (as a variable) or something that an organization is (as a metaphor) (Smircich, 1983). However, putting the variety aside for a moment, what it brings to light is that culture lies in the process of social interaction. Linstead &amp; Mullarkey (2003) once remarked that culture ‘arises as much from the <em>shared interaction</em> and practice of bodies as from the shared symbols of minds’ (emphasis added). In other words, everything that occurs during the interaction between individuals can be seen as culture, be it the language that people speak, the way people speak the language, the way people behave, and organization itself. If culture is a process that appears in every interaction, then to talk about organization&mdash;either as an institution or an action&mdash;one cannot escape to touch upon culture.</p>

<p>Among many forms of organization, family business has been receiving an increasing awareness and legitimacy as a field of study during the last 20 years (Sirmon, 2014). Sharma, Melin &amp; Nordqvist (2014) position the overarching aim of family business studies as ‘to build knowledge on one specific type of organizations&mdash;the family business.’ Two major points are stressed from this statement: knowledge building process, and the family business as a context. On the attempt for knowledge building, Berger &amp; Luckmann (1967) in their book about the sociology of knowledge, emphasize that ‘only with the appearance of a new generation can one properly speak of a social world.’ In other words, the social world is incomplete without the presence of the new generation. Of course, in reality it is impossible to isolate the social world from the new generations. But when speaking about the social world, the fact that we incorporate the intergenerational interaction marks its totality. The various interaction between and within the children, parents, and grandparents are what make the social world complex and more complete. Consequently, if the purpose of family business studies is to build knowledge on the family business, we are actually not only in the process of understanding family business per se; we are also in the process of, to a certain degree, understanding the (wider) social world.</p>

<p>What all these have to do with culture? There are two reasons. First, <em>family</em> business contains intergenerational interaction where the parents and their descendants are continuously in the process of culture (re)production. To recall from the earlier that culture is a process that appears in every interaction, the presence of both the horizontal and vertical generational interaction in family business may enrich and complicate the culture of this type of organization. Second, family <em>business</em> is a form of economic institution that operates under its own raison d’être, which adds another layer of cultural complexity. Thus, family business can be regarded as a holistic micro-environment of the wider social world where the social, economic, and political factors are intertwined. And from organizational culture studies, there are vast examples showing that cultural analysis holds the power to cut across these social, economic, and political issues (Clement, 1994; Hallett, 2003; Riad, 2005). Fruitful potentials lie ahead through the application of cultural theories in family business where both family business and organizational culture studies would benefit.</p>

<p>Throughout its development, family business as a field of study has been successful in importing theories from the adjacent fields such as organization theories, strategic management, and entrepreneurship (Sirmon, 2014). However, the contribution that family business domain have exported to other fields remains very limited. Against this background, this chapter serves to answer why it is increasingly important&mdash;and inevitable&mdash;to adopt cultural approach in family business settings, both as a way to advance our understanding of family business and to contribute to the larger field of social science. To fulfill its purpose, this chapter is organized in three sections that cover the past, present, and (possible) future of organizational culture in family business. The first section presents the historical overview of organizational culture in general. In this section, the different streams of research are outlined which cover the proliferation of perspectives in understanding organizational culture. On the second section, we bracket the cultural discussion within family business settings to get a narrower but deeper look on how culture has been used and exploited in family business research. We try to answer what and how does family business bring significance in understanding organizational culture, and how does culture help in understanding family business better. To close, the third section reflects upon the future challenges and possibilities of cultural approach in family business research.</p>
