  <h3>Why culture?</h3>

<p>I like the business world, but I don’t like if it is too much about money and profit. For me, business entity as a form of organization contains much more purpose than just for pursuing economic ends. I view it as a place of interaction where there are agreements and conflicts, understanding and misunderstanding, similarities and differences, and any sorts of activities that make life more fulfilling or even dulling.</p>

<p>Given this richness, my underlying interest of doing research is to understand the (social) world itself. In organizational context, this is translated to questions like: what does it mean to be organized? What does it mean to organize? </p>

<p>I found that the foundational way to understand this issue is through the cultural lens. To the best of my knowledge, culture theories provide ways of framing the basic assumptions a given group has, their values, norms, and behaviors. Culture also serves as a framework that people use to interpret their environment. How to adapt and survive. So, given the importance of culture in human interaction, I believe that there is much to be learned if I do research on (organizational) culture.</p>

<h3>Why in family business?</h3>

<p>It would be useful to borrow Berger &amp; Luckmann’s (1967)<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> explanation on how culture is formed and perceived differently by the founding generation and their descendants.</p>

<p>Imagine a case of two persons A and B:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As A and B interact, in whatever manner, typifications will be produced quite quickly. A watches B perform. He attributes motives to B’s actions and, seeing the actions recur, typifies the motives as recurrent. As B goes on performing, A is soon able to say to himself, ‘Aha, there he goes again.’ At the same time, A may assume that B is doing the same thing with regard to him. From the beginning, both A and B assume this reciprocity of typification. In the course of their interaction these typifications will be expressed in specific patterns of conduct. That is, A and B will begin to play roles <em>vis-a-vis</em> each other. (p. 74)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then when the next generation appears:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us push our paradigm one step further and imagine that A and B have children. At this point the situation changes qualitatively. The appearance of a third party changes the character of the ongoing social interaction between A and B, and it will change even further as additional individuals continue to be added. (pp. 75&ndash;76)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The example above illustrates how generational issue becomes an important aspect when speaking about culture. To understand how the culture is formed, modified and perpetuated, we need to take into account the inter-generational interaction in the family. This&mdash;the family&mdash;is the first layer.</p>

<p>The second layer is the business aspect of the family business. As a business entity, it has another reason of being: to engage in economic activity. So the kind of interactions that a family business is involved is much wider and more complex than a mere family or business institution. This combination of the two spheres, then, further complicate the culture that may arise from such interaction.</p>

<h3>Why visual ethnography? (and a bit about myself)</h3>

<p>I think my interest in visual methods/ethnography can be linked back to my personal interest in visual media such as graphic design, photography and videography. I used to run a start-up that produces promotional (and also documentary) videos and designs. Since my undergraduate degree, I love taking pictures and making short films. So back then I thought, why not build a company from these interests?</p>

<p>Then after finishing my bachelor, I took a master degree in entrepreneurship at Jönköping International Business School, Sweden. There I had a chance to officially register my start-up (called “Hompimpa Creativeworks”) and worked on several projects in Jönköping.</p>

<p>A couple of years later, I obtained my master degree and aspired to continue for a PhD. Long story short, I was interviewed by Denise and offered a PhD position at the University of Luxembourg. I accepted her offer and consequently decided to close my start-up to focus on the PhD.</p>

<p>I think Denise recognized my skills and interest in videography and photography. I’m very lucky, I have to say. Some weeks after Denise announced my acceptance as her PhD student, she suggested me to take a look on visual sociology/visual methods. When I did the search, I was blown away. I did not know such thing exists before, and visual methods is a perfect combination of the worlds that I am interested in: academic research <em>and</em> visual media.</p>

<p>So, I guess the excitement hasbeen growing from there. This PhD becomes more like a personal fulfillment where I can pour in my dedication into it.</p>

<p>Then finally, after I moved in to Luxembourg and officially work at the university, I learned that we need two internal supervisors and one external supervisor. For the external one, we agreed to include Leif Melin (he is a professor from Jönköping International Business School, Sweden). Then for the internal one, we were thinking to have a perspective outside of the pure business management field. Family business studies have been borrowing theories from the field of culture, but it seems that there is still nothing that family business field can give back to the field of anthropology. That is why we are so glad that you are interested to join the team. I’ve quickly read some of your papers and I was amazed to think about the potentials of what we can do together.</p>

<p>So, this is more or less the position where we are currently standing. Broadly speaking, my research project is about culture in family business. More specifically, Luxembourgish family business (I will send you the provisional table of content in the next email). There are some concerns of course with regard to the practicalities (such as language and access), but I think we can discuss them in our next meeting.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Ingrid for joining us. To prepare for our next meeting, I am sure I will need your suggestions for the readings. Looking forward to know your view about my research idea!</p>
