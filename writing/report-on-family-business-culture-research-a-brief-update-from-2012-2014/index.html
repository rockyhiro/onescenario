  <p>During the last three years, research on organizational culture in family business are still heavily weighted towards the managerialist-integrationist perspective. A Web search on the recently published journal articles has resulted in 22 articles that cover and/or relate to family business culture<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Out of these 22 articles, 5 papers are literature review and none of these are addressing—as a central theme—the different perspectives of how cultural research on family business are written.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the empirical studies have taken various contexts of small-, medium-, and large-sized family firms. Among these, one particularly interesting article is a critical study carried out by Day (2012)<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Based on dialectical relationship theory, she taps upon gender and power issues of the daughters in family firms. With the indiviuals (daughters) as the unit of analysis, she argues that family business daughters experienced relational tensions about motherhood that reflect the separate spheres that privilege the family and the business. This critical inquiry is among the rare cultural research that gives a different tone in the general conversation in family business studies, where most are taking firm-level or group-level analysis.</p>

<p>From the periphery, a growing acknowledgment is paid on the conception of socioemotional wealth. The concept is started to be central in family business studies as more and more scholars are joining to promote socioemotional wealth as a contribution that family business can give to the wider field of business management (Sirmon, 2014)<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. One study by Deephouse &amp; Jaskiewicz (2013)<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> integrates socioemotional wealth and social identity theories in relation with family firms performance. </p>

<p>Considering the above, two concerns can be raised:</p>

<ol>
<li>In particular about identity, Alvesson (2013)<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> argues that studies on identity has been an overlap with culture and there has been little reference from identity to the field of culture. With Deephouse &amp; Jaskiewicz’s (2013) attempt to integrate socioemotional wealth and social identity theories, there is a possibility to also argue that socioemotional wealth has some similarities with culture (particularly on the pattern of shared values, norms and behaviors). If this line of thought is plausible, then, can organizational culture make a claim that socioemotional wealth is only a subset of culture? Would an integration between culture and socioemotional wealth be possible? Or, before that, is it worth considering that socioemotional wealth can be related to organizational culture? What difference does it make, does the connection between these two open a possibility of new research areas for cultural studies in family firms?</li>
<li>Stepping aside from the hype of socioemotional wealth, family business culture scholars can instead focus on the enduring dominance of managerialist-integrationist perspective. Questions can be posed against this background, such as: What are the dangers inherent in perpetuating the dominant perspective? Is there any constraining factors (theoretical, methodological or political) that discourage scholars from pursuing non-managerialist approach in family business studies? If any, what are they? Or, does ‘family business studies’ implicitly privilege managerialist interest?</li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, studies on family business culture are exposed to cultural concerns in two fronts: (1) the subject of family business culture itself, and (2) the approach that family business scholars take in studying culture. These have been an issue since almost three decades ago and, from the publication during the last three years, there is still little sign if this is going to change. Within this light, the two concerns presented above could be of those that open new possibilities for future research on family business culture.</p>

<p>The journal articles are retrieved through web search in two steps. First, search on <a href="http://www.scopus.com/" title="Scopus">Scopus</a> is made with the keywords of “family business” OR “family firm” (with parentheses) AND ‘culture’. This query returned a result of 36 articles, which include several articles not related to business administration and its neighboring fields. Then, as a second step, the resulting articles are downloaded through <a href="http://www.findit.lu" title="findit.lu">findit.lu</a> as it provides access to online articles in the University of Luxembourg.
