    <h1>What is organizational culture?</h1>

<p><em>Anything and consequently nothing</em></p>

<p>In its broadest sense, the term ‘organizational culture’ is usually raised to refer to the shared way of thinking and/or doing that is unique in an organization. Historically, the concept of organizational culture had enjoyed rapid momentum in 1980s. This coincides with the rising success of Japanese corporations and the growing interest in the US to reinvigorate their firms’ performance (Alvesson, 2013). While the academic literature have been studying organizational culture since 1940s (Alvesson &amp; Berg, 1992), popular management books such as those by Ouchi (1981) and Peters and Waterman (1982) had helped to proliferate the interest on cultural research in business settings (see Morrill (2008) for a further backstory of the origin that stretches back to 1920s by Frederick Taylor and Henri Fayol).</p>

<p>Along with these, the concept of organizational culture is widely deﬁned. Schein (1983, p. 14), for example, deﬁnes culture as “the pattern of basic assumption that a given group has invented, discovered, or developed in learning to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration.” This pattern of assumption, he adds, is passed through new members as the way to frame and understand problems. Schein understands organizational culture as a tool for coping with reality and this echoes Pettigrew (1979, p. 574) who argues that culture is the system of collectively accepted meanings for people to function within any given setting. In a similar vein, Pettigrew stresses the contextual dependence where culture ensures the functioning of a group of individuals in their respective context.</p>

<p>Among the many organizational culture scholars, Martin (2002) is one of the loudest to voice the problem of a unitary view of culture in organizations. She argues that a singular perspective of organizational culture is leaving out an important aspect of organizational life, which is the plausibility of conflicts and ambiguities in organizations. She advocates that there are at least three ways to view organizational culture: integration, differentiation, and fragmentation perspectives. Now, corresponding to these differing perspectives, the definition of organizational culture ranges widely as well. The varying definitions are summarized in Martin (2002, p. 57).</p>
