    <h1>What is organizational culture?</h1>

<p><em>The source of a family of concepts</em></p>

<p><span class="leadin">In its broadest sense</span>, the term ‘organizational culture’ is usually raised to refer to the shared way of thinking and/or doing that is unique in an organization. Historically, the concept of organizational culture had enjoyed rapid momentum in 1980s. This coincides with the rising success of Japanese companies and the growing interest of the US corporations to reinvigorate their firms’ performance (Alvesson, 2013). The academic literature have been studying organizational culture since 1940s (Alvesson &amp; Berg, 1992), but it was not until popular management books such as that by Ouchi (1981) and Peters and Waterman (1982) that the notion of organizational culture was gaining a widespread popularity in the practical as well as the academic discourse (see Morrill (2008) for a further backstory that stretches back cultural studies in organizations to 1920s by Frederick Taylor and Henri Fayol).</p>

<p>Along with these, the concept of organizational culture is widely deﬁned. Schein (1983, p. 14), for example, deﬁnes culture as “the pattern of basic assumption that a given group has invented, discovered, or developed in learning to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration.” This pattern of assumption, he adds, is passed through new members as the way to frame and understand problems. Schein’s understanding of organizational culture as a tool for coping with reality echoes Pettigrew (1979, p. 574) who argues that culture is “the system of such publicly and collectively accepted meanings operating for a given group at a given time.” Culture ensures the functioning of a group of individuals in their respective context (Pettigrew, 1979).</p>

<p>Schein (1983, p. 14) gives a warning that “culture is not the overt behavior or visible artifacts one might observe on a visit to the company,” but rather, “it is the assumptions that underlie the values and determine not only behavior patterns, but also such visible artifacts as architecture, office layout, dress codes, and so on.” However, different from Schein, Pettigrew acknowledged that “while providing a general sense of orientation, culture treated as a unitary concept in this way lacks analytical bite” (1979, p. 574). Hence he devised that culture needs to be understood as an umbrella of a family of concepts: symbol, language, ideology, belief, ritual, and myth. The latter resembles Shrivastava (1985) who categorizes cultural products as myths and sagas, language systems and metaphors, symbolism, ceremony and rituals, and value systems and behavior norms.</p>

<p>Alvesson (2013, p. 3): “I use the term ‘organizational culture’ as an umbrella concept for a way of thinking which takes a serious interest in cultural and symbolic phenomena.”</p>

<p>Among the many organizational culture scholars, Martin (2002) is one of the leading proponents who point out the problem of a unitary view of culture in organizations. She argues that a singular perspective of organizational culture is leaving out an important aspect of organizational life, which is the plausibility of conflicts and ambiguities in organizations. She advocates that there are at least three ways to view organizational culture: integration, differentiation, and fragmentation perspectives. Now, corresponding to these differing perspectives, the definition of organizational culture ranges widely as well. The varying definitions are summarized in Martin (2002, p. 57).</p>
