    <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In the last two decades, family business research has been growing as an acknowledged field of study in social science. Yet&mdash;as it is positioned in the nexus of business management, anthropology, and sociology&mdash;its understanding in terms of culture remains confined in the view of culture as an instrument for achieving organizational goals. Culture is also used as a justification tool to legitimize the distinctiveness of family business as compared to other types of organization. In the attempt to set free from the shackle of instrumental view of culture in family business, I will revisit the origin of cultural studies in organization and then proceed forward to question its usage in the field of family business. In so doing, I will start by providing an exposition of its root in the field of organizational culture and followed by its importation in the field of family business. As I will show in the later enterprise, there are problems in the direct use of the concept of ‘family business culture’ and that we need to overcome this through new ways of imagining family business.</p>
