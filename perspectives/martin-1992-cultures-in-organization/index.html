    <p>Citation: Martin, J. (1992). <em>Cultures in Organization: Three Perspectives</em>. New York: Oxford University Press.</p>

<p>Studies conducted from an <em>Integration</em> perspective have three defining characteristics: all cultural manifestations mentioned are interpreted as consistently reinforcing the same themes, all members of the organization are said to share in an organization-wide consensus, and the culture is described as a realm where all is clear. Ambiguity is excluded.</p>

<p>Three kinds of cultural manifestations are frequently studied: forms, practices, and content themes.</p>

<ul>
<li>It has become increasingly clear that these [cultural] forms can provide important clues as to what employees are thinking, believing, and doing. The most studied cultural forms include: rituals, stories, jargon, humor, and physical arrangements (i.e., architecture, interior design, and dress codes).</li>
<li>Formal practices are generally written down and therefore are more easily controlled by management. Several types of formal practices have been of particular interest to cultural researchers: organizational structure, task and job description, technology, rules and procedures, and financial controls. In contrast, informal practices evolve through interaction and are seldom written down. Informal practice include, for example, unwritten norms, communication patterns, and standard operating procedures.</li>
<li>Content themes are commmon threads of concern that are seen as manifest in a subset of forms and practices. These themes can be deliberately espoused to an external audience &hellip; . Content themes can also be internal, either espoused deliberately &hellip; or the may emerge as tacit, deeply held assumptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Differentiation research goes one step farther, exploring the viewpoints of subcultures that see things differently.</p>

<p>Differentiation studies seek to understand the inconsistencies underlying appartently unifying abstractions.</p>

<p>Because the Differentiation perspective is particularly sensitive to differences in power and conflicts of interest between groups, few Differentiation studies contain subcultures that are purely orthogonal, that is, neither positive nor negative in orientation toward management or each other.</p>

<p>The Fragmentation perspective brings ambiguity to the foreground, rather than excluding it or channeling it outside a realm of cultural or subcultural clarity.</p>
