    <p>Citation: Smircich, L. (1983). Concepts of Culture and Organizational Analysis. <em>Administrative Science Quarterly</em>, 28, 339&ndash;358.</p>

<h2>(p. 339)</h2>

<p>This paper in particular traces the ways culture has been developed in organization studies: as a critical variable and as a root metaphor.</p>

<h2>(p. 342)</h2>

<p>The balance of the paper briefly summarizes five different programs of research that flow out of linking the terms culture and organization and examines their underlying assumptions and metaphors. In the first two, culture is either an independent or dependent, external or internal, organizational variable. In the final three, culture is not a variable at all, but is a root metaphor for conceptualizing organization. Each of these five represents a viable mode of inquiry. Considered together, they demonstrate that the promise of the concept of culture for the study of organization is varied and rich.</p>

<h2>(p. 345&ndash;346)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Culture, conceived as shared key values and beliefs, fulfills several important functions. First, it conveys a sense of identitity for organization members (Deal and Kennedy, 1982; Peters and Waterman, 1982). Second, it facilitates the generation of commitment to something larger than the self (Schall, 1981; Siehl and Martin, 1981; Peters and Waterman, 1982). Third, culture enhances social system stability (Louis, 1980; Kreps, 1981). And fourth, culture serves as a sense-making device that can guide and shape behavior (Louis, 1980; Meyer, 1981; Pfeffer, 1981; Siehl and Martin, 1981).</li>
<li>Some, however, genuinely question whether organization culture is indeed manageable.</li>
<li>For academics, culture provides a conceptual bridge between micro and macro levels of analysis, as well as a bridge between organizational behavior and strategic management interests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>(p. 347)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Some theorists advance the view that organizations be understood as cultures. They leave behind the view that a culture is something an organization <em>has</em>, in favor of the view that a culture is something an organization <em>is</em> (Smircich, 1981).</li>
<li>It represents a shift from comparison with physical objects to comparison with another social phenomenon, an undertaking with greater room for ambiguity because of culture&rsquo;s nonconcrete status.</li>
<li>Culture as a root metaphor for organizations goes beyond the instrumental view of organizations derived from the machine metaphor and beyond the adaptive view derived from the organismic metaphor.</li>
<li>Culture as a root metaphor promotes a view of organizations as expressive forms, manifestations of human consciousness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>(p. 353)</h2>

<ul>
<li>The mode of thought that underlies culture as a root metaphor gives the social world much less concrete status. The social world is not assumed to have an objective, independent existence that imposes itself on human beings. Instead, the social or organizational world exists only as a pattern of symbolic relationships and meanings sustained through the continued processes of human interaction. Social action is considered possible because of consensually determined meanings for experience that, to an external observer, may have the appearance of an independent rule-like existence.</li>
<li>When culture is a root metaphor, the researcher&rsquo;s attention shifts from concerns about what do organizations accomplish and how may they accomplish it more efficiently, to how is organization accomplished and what does it mean to be organized?</li>
</ul>
