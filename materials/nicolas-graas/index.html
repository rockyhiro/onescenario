    <p>So, as a little joke, I said, I went first to Prolingua to learn English and then I went to Bank of Luxembourg to realize my dreams. [laughter]</p>

<p>My great grandfather was also called Nicolas Gaas, and he imported the first Model T in Luxembourg in 1924. After trip to America to visit ancestors, my parents imported the first Hermes scarf in 1968. A long time ago. Soon 50 years, from generations to generations my family has tried to build the success and failures.</p>

<p>So first of all number one I will talk about opportunity and obstacle. My father saw the car business as an opportunity for long time as he loves cars. It wasn’t one for him as in for personal and family reasons. He never found his place in this company. So I said[?] it was an obstacle to his life and his career. He then founded Hermes in the late 60s, which became four years later a fantastic opportunity for my sister and me. My father died in 92 and Ford went bust early [two] thousand also there was a huge value in real estate. My mother helped us a lot in the beginning and developed the business and my sister was there as well. Myself, after ten years at Sodexo, company that some of you probably know, by the lunch vouchers. I joined the company after ten years, after learning in different establishment. It bonded our family. I’m talking about my mother, my sister, and me. And we went on to create various companies around it in Luxembourg and India today as well.</p>

<p>The number two point is continuation and termination. To continue a family business one needs a lot of patience and understanding and trust. I think you all agree with me on that. If the business grows year on year it is easier. Because it is possible to accommodate everybody’s needs in the family. Business has always to be first and has to be protected at all costs. As needs and expectations are different at any given time, for everybody, the risk of failure is big. One thing that is important in Luxembourg is that the inheritance process is easier because we have no taxes, inheritance taxes, which is we will take it for granted but it makes a huge difference. In other countries it’s much more difficult.</p>

<p>Number three, emotion and indifference. Most entrepreneurs have to go a very difficult times to build the business. It is very rare that the next generation understands what the parents have to go through to make the business survive. Example, Apple, you all know Steve Jobs, he lost his company first, then came back, built it, and today it’s the most valuable company in the world. The challenge is that in family you often mix emotion with business. In larger companies, company families hire professionals to avoid that. Example, I remember the President of Hermes, Jean-Louis Dumas, who some of you might know, he had to leave for health reasons and he hired a professional manager to run the company, Patrick Thomas who did an incredible job in responding to the attack of LVMH a couple of years ago. And he also had to run the families, because in Hermes family there is already, over 18 members today.</p>

<p>Some family members can be indifferent to growing a business, but they are just interested in the financial rewards. This can put a business at risk. In a small family like ours, it can be managed easily.</p>

<p>Number four, I would like to talk about responsibility and neglect. When generations work together, it is very difficult to determine the responsibilities. There is what you call a legal one, and there is an operational one. Very often younger generation knows always better. But as they did not go through the hard times, they can easily neglect various important matters. In India where where we are building a cookwork distribution company called Wonderchef today, a lot of respect is given to the elders as they stand for experience. We should always respect that. The so-called neglect of younger generations combined to the responsible one of the elder can nevertheless be a fantastic combination when communications channels stay open, like you said before [addressing the previous speaker].</p>

<p>Number five, the matter of respect is very important. It has to go both ways. Younger generations are often not respected for their ideas as they have to prove during tens of years that they deserve to run a business. How many times have you seen sons giving up taking over as they can’t work with their fathers. Criticism kills a relationship. One only dialogue and respect can create a virtuous environment. As it takes obsession and paranoia to build a company, you remember to book of the founder of Intel maybe, the elder generation is often disappointed by the efforts that are put in by the younger one.</p>

<p>Finally number six, the pressure. The pressure we were talking about it before, the pressure of the younger generations can be sometimes unbearable. I remember when the Sodexo founder, Pierre Bellon, where I worked for many years, he had put his son in England to run the branch there. The branch was a disastrous situation. The father wanted the son to prove that he would actually work in a very challenging situation. The son never made it. He collapsed, he gave up, he was frustrated, he left the group. I don’t think it’s a big success.</p>

<p>Because for entrepreneurs who start companies like that and here with Pierre Bellon, we are talking about a man who build a 25 billion dollar company, so, it’s a different size, nothing is impossible. Nothing is enough, nothing is never enough, we work day and night for him, and he does never accept, he would never accept that there is no way to find a solution. They are obsessed, they have a special breed.</p>

<p>It is very rare that kids have this drive. Very often they want to live differently, as you just said. Therefore transmission with success is a huge challenge for both generation, and it can only be achieved with a lot of efforts from both sides. It is amazing when it works. Thank you.</p>
