    <blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; [O]nly with the appearance of a new generation can one properly speak of a social world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Berger &amp; Luckmann (1967, p. 61) in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Social-Construction-Reality-Sociology-Knowledge-ebook/dp/B004X36R6G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411116512&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sociology+of+knowledge"><em>The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge</em></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If science is to be possible the world must consist of enduring and transfactually active mechanism; society must consist of an ensemble of powers irreducible but present only in the intentional actions of men; and men must be causal agents capable of acting self-consciously on the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Bhaskar (2013, p. 20) in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Realist-Science-Classical-Critical-Routledge-ebook/dp/B001PNYK3E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411116100&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+realist+theory+of+science"><em>A Realist Theory of Science</em></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For other researchers, trained to appreciate large sample sizes, random sampling procedures, reliability and validity measures, and statistical tests, a disdain for generalization is hard to comprehend: isn’t building theory, they ask, the goal of empirical research? What use is a study unless the goal is to understand what causes a phenomenon and to use that knowledge to predict, under appropriate conditions, what effects will occur? At the very least, shouldn’t one seek multiple, systematic comparisons to build generalizations within and across case studies of culture? &hellip; There is some tendency for a concern with generalizability to be congruent with an objectivist approach to representation, which in turn has some congruence with being-realism and a search for causal laws.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Martin (2003, p. 403) in <em>Meta-Theoretical Controversies</em> by Joanne Martin, a book chapter in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Handbook-Organization-Theory-Meta-theoretical/dp/0199275254/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413142869&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=oxford+handbook+of+organization+theory"><em>The Oxford Handbook of Organization Theory</em></a> edited by Tsoukas &amp; Knudsen</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Academic institutions, after all, function as all institutions do: they provide closure to meaning, privileging particular ways of observing, thinking and arguing, and build particular reward systems around them. In that respect, it is only too easy to be seduced by a favourite theory and to dogmatically cling on to that which we are familiar and comfortable with.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Tsoukas &amp; Chia (2011, p. 4) in <em>Introduction: Why Philosophy Matters to Organization Theory</em> by Haridimos Tsoukas and Robert Chia, an introduction to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Organization-Research-Sociology-Organizations/dp/0857245953/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413750784&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=haridimos+tsoukas"><em>Philosophy and Organization Theory</em></a> edited by Tsoukas &amp; Chia</p>
