    <h1>Culture and family business</h1>

<p><em>A critique and gut feelings</em></p>

<p>The gush of family business studies that employ the notion of organizational culture follows a similar fashion as that in the wider organization studies: the concept of culture is used as an instrument to promote the distinctiveness of family business (as opposed to non-family business) in management studies. Repeating the history of earlier allegation that ascribes the competitiveness of Japanese corporations to the peculiarity of their culture, family business scholars reanimate this tone by proposing that it is the organizational culture of a family business that makes it perform better. Similarly, family business consultants also play a strong role in voicing this argument, as can be seen through the popularity of the works by Dyer (1986) and Denison (2004) in the literature.</p>

<p>In family business, however, the notion of organizational culture gets more complicated. If we accept that ‘organizational culture’ is culture that is situated within the boundary of an organization, then in family business we need to consider the presence of two kinds of institution: the family and the business. If there are two institutions within a family business, then what is its ‘organizational’ culture?</p>

<p>At this point, we enter the difficulty of considering organizational culture as a single, integrated entity. Even without the presence of family dimension in the organization, the view of singular culture in an organization is already a problematic one.</p>

<p>Insofar as the business is entirely peopled by those that occupy positions in the family, the chance of equating family culture <em>as</em> business culture is pretty high. As soon as there is a non-family person involved working <em>for</em> the family, then, the closure is broken down.</p>
