    <h1>Culture and family business</h1>

<h2>On the import of cultural studies in family business</h2>

<p>The gush of studies in family business field that employ the notion of organizational culture follows a similar fashion as that in the wider organization studies: the concept of culture is used as an instrument to leverage the distinctiveness of family business (as opposed to non-family business) in management studies. Repeating the history of earlier allegation to ascribe the rise of Japanese corporations is due to the peculiarity of their culture, family business scholars reanimate this tone by proposing that the organizational culture of a family business is what makes it perform better. Similarly, family business consultants also play a strong role in voicing this argument as can be seen through the popularity of the works by Dyer (1986) and Denison (2004) in the literature.</p>

<h2>Some guts about it</h2>

<p>It must be stated, and also as a reminder to myself, that the aim of this endeavor is not only to indulge in academic sophistication&mdash;this is mandated through the completion of a PhD&mdash;but also to be practically useful. In other words, common people should find value to enhance their understanding of family business.</p>

<p>Culture is the practice, the way of thinking and the way of doing that bond people together. The modifier of ‘organizational’ signifies the boundary in which the culture we seek to understand.</p>

<p>In family business, however, this notion gets more complicated. If we accept that ‘organizational culture’ is culture that is bounded within an organization, then in family business we need to consider the presence of two kinds of institution: that is the family and the business. If there are two institutions within a family business, then what is its ‘organizational’ culture?</p>

<p>At this point, we enter the difficulty of considering organizational culture as a single, integrated entity. Even without the presence of family dimension in the organization, the view of singular culture in an organization is already a problematic one.</p>

<p>Insofar as the business is entirely peopled by those that occupy positions in the family, the chance of equating family culture <em>as</em> business culture is pretty high. As soon as there is a non-family person involved working <em>for</em> the family, then, the closure is broken down.</p>
