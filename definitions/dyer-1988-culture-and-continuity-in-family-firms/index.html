<h2>(p. 18)</h2>

<p>The culture of any group can be viewed on four levels: artifacts, perspectives, values, and assumptions (Schein, 1985; Dyer, 1986).</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Artifacts</em> are the more tangible aspects of culture. They are physical—the dress, physical layout, company logo, and other emblems used by a group; verbal&mdash;the language, jargon, stories, and myths shared by the group; and behavioral&mdash;the common rituals, ceremonies, and behavioral patterns. Artifacts are the most visible manifestations of culture, but to fully understand a culture, one must decipher the shared meanings behind them.</li>
<li>Artifacts can be thought of as the symbolic representations of the next level of culture, socially shared perspectives.</li>
<li><em>Perspectives</em> are the norms and rules of conduct that the group deems acceptable for handling such problems as developing a new product, giving a performance appraisal, hiring and training new employees, or gaining a promotion.</li>
<li><em>Values</em> are broader principles, such as Serve the Customer, Be Honest, or Do Not Question Superiors.</li>
<li>Values are both formal and informal, and they can often be found in the “philosophy” espoused by the group. Since groups do not always act in accordance with their espoused values, distinguishing between the ideal and real values is critical in doing a cultural analysis.</li>
<li>At the foundation of the culture are the group’s <em>basic assumptions</em>. The other three levels of culture are based on this most fundamental level. Assumptions are the premises on which a group bases its world views and on which the artifacts, perspectives, and values are based.</li>
<li>In family firms, certain kinds of assumptions are often found regarding the nature of relationships, human nature, the nature of truth, the environment, time, the nature of human activity, and whether preferential treatment should be given to certain individuals.</li>
</ul>
